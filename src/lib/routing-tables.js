/**
 * When routing payments across multiple ledgers, each hop will round the amounts
 * according to the precision of the ledger. These rounding errors can accumulate
 * to the point where a connector later in a path may receive an amount that is
 * less than the rate they are willing to accept.
 *
 * Connectors broadcast slightly pessimistic rate curves in order to compensate for
 * rounding errors across multi-hop routes. They shift the curve by the maximum
 * amount that could be lost due to rounding errors, so that even if the incoming
 * amount is rounded down by that amount the resulting value will still match the
 * connector's minimum rate.
 *
 * Connectors use unshifted rate curves locally to determine whether an incoming
 * payment request matches their minimum rate. When applying this rate, they round
 * in their favor to ensure that they never accept a payment that is lower than their rate.
 *
 * This class maintains two sets of routing.RoutingTables: the "local" tables are
 * the optimistic ones and the "public" tables are the pessimistic ones.
 *
 * The "local" tables consist of the raw local routes, joined to adjacent connector's
 * (public, shifted) routes. They are used for findBestHopFor*, the results of which
 * must be rounded in the connector's own favor to ensure that they don't lose money.
 *
 * The "public" tables consist of the local shifted routes, joined to the remote
 * (shifted) routes. Before joining, the local routes are shifted right by
 * 1/10^destination_ledger_scale to account for rounding errors. Their curves are
 * broadcast to adjacent connectors.
